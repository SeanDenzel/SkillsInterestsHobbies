    <h2> Skills </h2>
    <!--Skills paragraph-->
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As a second year BSIT student studying at University of the East, I have learned a couple of programming language such as Python, Java, MySQL, C#, and currently, I am learning HTML and CSS. I have already made some progress on my journey
        in learning HTML, I have written my first HTML biography, and made a simple prototype enrollment system website. Python was the first programming language that I learned back then, it was uncharted territory for me because I really have no experience
        with any programming languages except learning a little bit of HTML and Arduino Uno in highschool. In my first year studying programming in UE, I have developed an understanding of logic, syntaxes, and some problem solving. Java has also helped
        me in learning object oriented programming as well as its general value for software development. MySQL helped me understand how databases function as I used it to store, retrieve and manipulate data well. I now understand game creation and software
        programs. This understanding came from gaining knowledge of C#. As I diligently study, I anticipate thoroughly learning HTML and CSS like to considerably improve my web development skills. Because I'm good at debugging and troubleshooting, my
        logical thinking has improved. I have also done small projects requiring analytical and original thought. Even though programming has many difficulties, I get large satisfaction from fixing problems with code. I especially enjoy collaborating
        with all my classmates on many projects, for teamwork greatly improves our learning experience. Learning new programming languages expanded my technical skills greatly and made me far more flexible. My plan is to use what I know about backend
        development to make more complex systems. The key goal is to construct one functional website by integrating both front-end and back-end technologies. I want to explore all aspects of mobile app development, using every framework like Flutter
        or React Native. My view of creating software changes as I learn each programming language. Now I can debug and scrutinize code a lot better than I used to. I anticipate a number of changes. These changes will affect my skills over the next several
        years. </p>

        <h2> Hobbies </h2>
        <!--Hobbies paragraph-->
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite hobbies is playing computer games. I enjoy immersing myself in different virtual worlds, whether it's through story-driven games like Elden Ring, Sekiro, Ghost of Tsushima, or Cyberpunk 2077, and I also love competitive
            multiplayer matches, or strategy-based gameplay such as League of Legends, Rainbow six Siege, Counter Strike and more. Gaming allows me to unwind after long study sessions, giving me a way to relax while also sharpening my reflexes and decision-making
            skills. I also enjoy the social aspect of gaming, as I often play with friends and communicate with them through voice chats. Multiplayer games teach me teamwork and coordination, while single-player games challenge me to solve puzzles and
            think critically. Another hobby of mine is playing basketball. Basketball has been a part of my life since I was young, and I enjoy playing with friends whenever I get the chance. It keeps me active and helps improve my endurance, agility,
            and teamwork skills. The fast-paced nature of basketball makes it exciting, and I love the challenge of competing against others. In addition to basketball, I also have developed an interest in going to the gym. Working out helps me stay in
            shape, build strength, and improve my overall fitness. It has been a year since I started lifting and I must say I am proud of my decision to start lifting some heavy weights. I enjoy lifting weights and doing exercises that target different
            muscle groups such as Chest, Back, Arms, and Legs. It has become a staple every week to lift some weights and a great way to relieve stress and stay disciplined with my health. I also like tracking my progress and setting fitness goals for
            myself. I have even bought some dumbbells at home in case I didn't have time to go to the Gym because of school work. Lifting weights, playing basketball, and gaming provide a balance between mental and physical activity in my life. These
            hobbies keep me motivated, help me develop new skills, and bring me joy. I always look forward to improving in one of these aspects in my life, to lift more, to play basketball better, and to mentally play games with fun and precision. These
            hobbies are very important in keeping me motivated everyday and each of them is something that I really care about.</p>

        <h2> Interests </h2>
        <!--Interests paragraph-->
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Music has consistently remained an important part of my life, because I appreciate carefully exploring many genres and artists. K-pop, offering appealing tunes in conjunction with great dance moves as well as many kinds of music, is
            one of my main interests. I favor a few K-pop groups. NewJeans is one of them. Their fresh concept, unique style, and nostalgic yet modern sound make their music enjoyable and refreshing.Among their album releases and songs, I really like
            Ditto, How Sweet, Supernatural, and Super Shy. I really admire and love their talent, stage presence, and ability to push creative boundaries. Aside from K-pop, I also love listening to artists like Keshi, Metro Boomin, Travis Scott, and Kendrick
            Lamar. Keshi’s music has a mellow, emotional vibe that I find relaxing, and his ability to blend R&B and lo-fi elements makes his sound unique. Metro Boomin’s production skills are unmatched, and I appreciate how he creates atmospheric beats
            that elevate any song. Travis Scott’s music is full of energy, with hypnotic beats and a signature sound that sets him apart in the hip-hop scene. Kendrick Lamar, on the other hand, is one of the best lyricists in the industry, and I admire
            how his music carries deep messages about society, culture, and personal experiences. Whether it’s K-pop, R&B, or hip-hop, I enjoy discovering new artists and appreciating the different emotions and stories their music conveys. Music is not
            only plain entertainment but also a source of inspiration, motivation and relaxation for me. Each song fits every moment perfectly. I am invariably in the mood for upbeat tracks or more laid-back ones. I also enjoy watching many live shows,
            concerts, along with music documentaries because I like seeing how artists fully realize their original ideas. I appreciate the way music thoroughly connects people and strongly evokes emotions. No matter the genre, music is an important part
            of my daily life. As I go to school or go home I listen to music no matter what. Music is a part of me and who I am.</p>
